## Introduction: 
FicTroupe is a community for writers, artists, and tabletop gamers to store and share their original characters. 

## Project Description
Creators of all kinds often rely on folders of character sheets or Google Docs to store information on their original characters. We want to provide a clean and convenient experience for creators to store their characters’ info, stats, and reference images. 

## User Story

- AS A artist/writer/D&D player/creator
- I WANT to have a MERN stack character-theme website 
- SO THAT I can store, share, and trade my original characters


## Acceptance Criteria: 

- Use React for the front end.
- Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
- Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
- Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
- Use a polished UI.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data)
- BE interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Include authentication (JWT).
- Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standard.
- Look professional and be mobile-friendly.

## Heroku Deployment:

## Plans For Future Development
- The ability for users to “adopt” other characters.
- A commission system for users to request new custom characters
- Scalable image hosting
- Comments and other social systems 
- Tagging of characters based on user generated tags
- More robust homepage with filter, follow a tag or precise user targeted content based on their behavior
